## Why?

The LinkedIn API *used* to be *really good* (*back in 2012* ... )
but in 2015 someone decided to reduce access to "*normal developers*" so they can charge "*partners*" for increased access ...

If there was a way to get profile data directly from the API
we would *not* have to waste our time
***Parsing*** the ***Public Profile Pages*** ...

But, that's the [*state*](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/linkedin)
we're in, so this is what we *have* to do.

## What?

As the name suggests this node.js module lets you
parse the *public* profile page for any LinkedIn profile
by supplying a valid LinkedIn URL.


## How?

### Basic usage

> **Note**: This Node.js Module ***ONLY*** Works as a ***SERVER-Side Script***  
(LinkedIn Blocks *ALL* Browser-Based *CORS* Requests)

Install the `linkedin-public-profile-parser` package from NPM:

```sh
npm install linkedin-public-profile-parser --save
```

Then in your code:

```js
var LP = require('linkedin-public-profile-parser');
var url = 'https://uk.linkedin.com/in/simonlab';
LP(url, function(err, data){
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)); // see below for sample output JSON
})
```

### Want More?

if you want ***more control*** over the process try this:

```sh
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3" https://uk.linkedin.com/in/iteles -o test/fixtures/iteles.html
```

Then parse the html you just downloaded:

```js
var fs      = require('fs');
var profile = require('../lib/profile');
var file = __dirname + '/fixtures/iteles.html'
var url = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/iteles';

fs.readFile(file, function(err, html) {
  profile(url, html, function(err, data){
    console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  })
})
```

Which will print out the following *parsed* result:

```js

Ever the natural co-ordinator, I hold various positions leading teams and organising meetups (Ladies Who Code).Always happy to have a chat about anything I can help with or answer questions, get in touch!",

## tl;dr

Because LinkedIn has *blocked* the IP address of *any* server
running on the Amazon, Azure or DigitalOcean data center (*by IP range...*)
see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/32615188/1148249
we are unable to run a full end-to-end test on Travis-CI.

Our work-around for this is that Travis-CI tests our *parser*
but not our "*requester*". To run the *full* (*end-to-end*) test suite on
your local machine use the following command:

```sh
npm run full
```
